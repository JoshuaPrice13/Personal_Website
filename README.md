  Hello everyone,
If you are reading this, you must be interested in me or my coding skills. Either way I want to say welcome and thank you for your time.
There will be 3 sections in this file.
  1. Overview, this section will be unchanging telling you how and why I am doing this project.
  2. Features, in this section, I will explain what each feature is and how I implemented it. I will update this with each new feature.
  3. Logs, this is how I will keep track of my progress as well as show you the indivual steps to creating this master piece!

    ~Overview~
In this repository I will store all of the file that are used in my personal website. First of all, why am I created a personal website? Well, for 
multiple reasons, but mostly for people like you so that you may see what I have acomplished and what I am capable of in terms of software development!
On the technical side, I will have a web server that is run on a small MeLE PCG02. I will use this small computer as my server. I chose to do this for 2 reasons: 
For 1, I think it would give me a good challenge and be good expirence to implement this feature rather than using a paid for server that handles all the setup
for me. For 2, this is also a free alternative to hosting... and I am struggling college student lol. Overall I am excited for this project and the things 
I will learn along the way, thank you for reading all of this.

    ~Features~
Feature 1: I have just created my "index.html". This will be the source code for the first page people see on my website.

    ~Logs~
11-4-24: Downloaded and setup Apache2.4 on my server. Created index.html and pushed it to github. Next step is to buy a domain name and set up my server IP to 
          that domain.
